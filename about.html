            One of our first physical creations and services we offer is custom made 3D printed lithopanes. These are magnificent works of art that reveal intricate images when light passes through them. Each lithopane undergoes a quality check before reaching your hands.

            While our dreams are just beginning to come to life; we hold fast to a bigger vision and future. We aim to become the studio where imagination meets innovation— where art, free tools, custom designs, video games, and so much more all come together to form a universe of creations.
